- enable translating only 10 words - and then ask for login

- login dialog - to load all the words

- if user clicks the word plus button before login, it will show login dialog

- after login - it will add word to user words table , and show V sign. 



























- practice 
    - multiple choice. 
        - 1 translation , many words
        - 1 word , many translations
    - missing letters also



























- add text page
    - UI
    - check text exists in url

- make everything super pretty

- bookmarks
    - create user bookmarks to db
    - save bookmark to db on word click
    - load bookmark from db on text click. and show bookmark and scroll to word.


- try to work with react-context instead of redux for a while - see how it goes.
